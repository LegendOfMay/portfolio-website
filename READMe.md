Building My first Personal Website 

Table of contents :

- Home Page : I open up the website with a small introduction of who i am and what i am trying to accomplish. I led with a qoute and a few AI images i produced a while back. I thought the images would set the tone for the website. 

- About : On this page i filled the blocks of information with Lorem ipsum but the this have been my journey so far. I headed this page with "Coding a path to the future" just to be dramatic. Then i followed up with a few images that made sense to me. 

- Portfolio : On the portfolio page you will find more AI generated images that i put together into a themed collection. It was the only thing that i could think of that i sorta created. I enjoyed being able to put the images together for the first time. Hopefully you can enjoy the images and creative collection names. 

I look forward to adding more to this website. I am a complete beginner with no prior coding experience so i am really proud of my work so far & i had fun.

I need to add a footer and social media links to the profile. 

Have a good day, you dont have to go home BUT . . . ðŸ«¡
